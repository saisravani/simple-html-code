<h1>about flowers</h1>
<p><font color="992299">A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the</br> reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division</br> Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function</br> of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for</br> the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm</br> and eggs from different individuals in a population) or </br>allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower).</br> Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). </br>Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many </br>flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause</br> them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After</br> fertilization, the ovary of the flower developsv into fruit containing seeds.</br>

In addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants,</br> flowers have long been admired and used by humans </br>to bring beauty to their environment, and </br>also as objects of romance, ritual, religion,</br> medicine and as a source of food.</br>
